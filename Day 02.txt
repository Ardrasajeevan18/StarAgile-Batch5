Linux File System/Folder Structure
-----------------------------------------------
=> In Linux OS everything will be represented as File.
=> Root Directory (/) is starting point of Linux machine
=> Inside root directory we have several directories like below
/home : It contains users home directories
	/home/kastro : Kastro home directory
	/home/kiran : Kiran home directory
	/home/ec2-user : ec2-user home directory
/bin : Essentials ready-to-run-program (binaries)	
/boot : static files of boot loader
/dev : device files
/lib : Shared libraries
/etc : host specific configurations
/opt : Optional application software packages
/tmp : Temporary files will be stored here
/usr : user utilities and applications
/mnt : Mounted File system
/media : Removal Media

To go to root directory ---> cd / ----> pwd ----> You will see / ---> ls ---> You will see default directory structure
To go inside a default directory
$ cd /<DirectoryName>

To check which OS and flavor
cat /etc/os-release

$ at the end of line represents normal user
# at the end of line represents root user
~ at the end inside the [ ] represents home directory

To know about a particular command. We can do that in two ways;
Ex: man cp (man represents manual) (Here im trying to know about "cp" command)
Ex: cp --help (Here im trying to know about "cp" command)

To know in which path the commands are available in Linux directory;
which ls --- you will see the details
which cp --- you will see the details
which mv --- you will see the details

To know the Private IP address of VM
hostname -i

To know the machine name of the VM
hostname

To set the name of the VM
hostnamectl set-hostname <GiveNameForTheVM>

To know the machine name of the VM
hostname
sudo -i ---> You will see the hostname whatever you have set

To see for how long the VM is running
uptime

ls -a (or) ls -al : display hidden files

=> FIND Command
To find the file created. This is used when we dont know where we have created the file
find /home/ec2-user/ -name <FileName> ---> This command will search for the file in /home/ec2-user/ path.
But if you dont know the path ---> find / -name <FileName>

=> MOVE Command
mv : To rename and move files & directories
		mv <OldDirName> <NewDirName>
		mv <OldFileName> <NewFileName>
		mv presention-location new-location

How to copy the content from one file to another file?
$ cat <File1Name> > <File2Name>
Note: This command will override the existing content

If you dont want to override the existing content;
$ cat <File1Name> >> <File2Name>
$ cat <File1Name> >> <File2Name> <File3Name> <File4Name>

		# print file data from top to bottom
		cat f1.txt

		# print file data with line numbers
		cat -n f1.txt		

		To print the line numbers
		cat -n <FileName>

=> COPY Command
1. To copy the content of one file to another file: cp
Create a file with content inside it
To copy the content of file1 into file2
cp <File1Name> <File2Name>
Note: If File2 is not available, first it will create File2 and then it will copy the content from File1 to File2
To copy the files in directory 1 to directory 2
cp -r <Dir1Name>/ <Dir2Name>/

Note: If we want to copy data from multiple files then we should use cat command
		cat f1.txt f2.txt > f3.txt

2. Lets say i want to copy a specific file inside a directory to /home/ec2-user path
Create a directory
Go inside directory
Create a file inside that directory
Lets copy the file to /home/ec2-user path: cp <FileName> /home/ec2-user

3. To copy the entire content (all files) from directory1 to directory2
cp -r <Directory1Name>/* <Directory2Name>/
/* represents whatever is there in that directory everything will get copied
Steps;
Create dir1 --- Create 5 files inside it --- Execute the above command to copy --- Go inside dir2, you will see dir1 --- go inside dir1 which is there in dir2 ---- ls --- you will see the files which got copied from dir1

=> WordCount Command
To know the word count in a file
$ wc <FileName>

3 12 56 kk.txt

3 ---> Number of lines in the file
12 ---> Number of words in the file
56 ----> Number of characters in the file
kk.txt ----> File Name

To see the number of lines available in a file
$ :set number

How to go a specific line?
$ :<LineNumber>

To copy a specific line
$ yy

To paste the copied line
$ p

How to delete a line?
$ dd

How to undo?
$ u

How to redo?
$ control + r

How to delete a specific number of lines at time?
$ <NumberOfLinesYouWantToDelete>dd

How to copy and paste a specific number of lines?
$ <NumberOfLinesYouWantToCopy>pp

To delete everything available inside a file?
$ :%d

=> GREP command
GREP - Global Regular Expression Print
GREP command is used to search for a word
GREP will process the text line by line and prints the lines which contains the word

Syntax: grep '<WordName>' <FileName>

the above command is case sensitive

1. How to ignore the case sensitiveness while using grep command
grep -i '<WordName>' <FileName>

2. How to search for a word in all the files at a time?
grep -i 'WordName>' *

	 # print lines which contains java keyword
	 grep '<WordName>' <FileName>

	 # ignore case-sensitive
	 grep -i '<WordName>' <FileName>

	 # print along with line numbers 
	 grep -n '<WordName>' <FileName>

	 # print lines which doesn't contains 'java' keyword (invert match)
	 grep -v '<WordName>' <FileName>

WinSCP Setup - Transferring Files From Windows to Linux
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here we will use .ppk file. Launch an instance with .ppk file

WinSCP is a tool that is used to transfer files from Windows to Linux

Download WinSCP to laptop: https://winscp.net/eng/download.php#google_vignette
Install WinSCP

In VM make sure you are in /home/ec2-user ---> create one empty file in this path

Open WinSCP in laptop ----> In the login window, File Protocol: SFTP ----> Click on 'Close' ----> You will see 2 windows. In both windows you will see the downloads folder (by default)

In the top bar (right side) ----> NewTab ----> File Protocol: SFTP ----> Host Name: Public IP of VM, Port No. 22, Username: ec2-user ----> Click on 'Advanced' ----> SSH (leftpane) ----> Authentication (leftpane) ----> Under the 'Private key file' click on ... (3 dots) and select the ppk file ----> OK ----> Login ----> Accept
On the left side you will see windows and on the right side you will see VM connected tab with path as /home/ec2-user.
In the left side pane, select any path (Ex: Downloads folder) and select a file and drag and drop that file to the right side window i.e your VM tab.

Goto Moba and execute ls ----> Whatever file you have dragged and dropped the same file you will see here. This is the easiest way to copy the files from Windows to Linux
